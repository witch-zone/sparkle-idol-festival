For Valentine's day 2017, yen and dani from the [witch zone](http://witch.zone) thought to surprise their dear Love Live!-loving friends by making them into real idols! To do that, we went all-out and created our own little parody of the Love Love! School Idol Festival mobage.

This repo is a little extra magic on top of that—a little site which mimicks some screens from the game in order to give everyone access to higher-resolution-er versions of all the illustrations, and to add some cute little bits of backstory to the project. It's also a little bit showy, because that's **magic** ✨

The illustrations for this project were created by [Yen Quach](http://yendraws.com), and are incredibly lovely.

      Robin spent a lot of last year cosplaying idols, and so surprised everyone pretty hard in 2017 by getting heavily into pretend guns and real rowdy boys. ðŸ˜˜ðŸ‘Œ We try not to let them have too many guns. Robin is also directly responsible for getting Dani into Love Live!, and therefore for making all of this possible!

      Robin will be cosplaying You Watanabe later this year, and doing a lot of in-character squats. We're all a little worried that they're going to try and throw Harley over their shoulder&hellip;

      Co-head witch of the witchâ™¥zone and quite possibly actually Nico in real life, Yen is responsible for all of the illustrations in the Sparkle Idol Festival! She also takes part in both the #draweveryday and #mischiefeveryday challenges. Expert in glitter-tier posting, and wholehearted believer in the power of MUD.

      Yen will be cosplaying Yohane later this year, and all the other members will become her little devils. They just donâ€™t know that yet. ðŸ˜ˆðŸ’œ
